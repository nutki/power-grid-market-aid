<h1>Korea</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In Korea, due to the division of the country, the political situation is very different compared to the countries of the other Power Grid maps.
The players are confronted first with richly varying geographical challenges, making building expensive. In addition, because of the
political division, the players must buy their resources from a divided market.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>In Korea, there are two separate resource markets, one for the north and one for the south, At the beginning, the players load the markets
with resources from the high end to the prices shown below:
<ul>
<li><b>North:</b> coal - 1 Elektro, oil - 3 Elektro, garbage - 7 Elektro.</li>
<li><b>South:</b> coal - 1 Elektro, oil - 3 Elektro, garbage - 7 Elektro, uranium - 14 Elektro.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Playing the game</h2>
<h3>Phase 3: Buying Resources</h3>
<p>The players can buy from either market, regardless of where they have built their power grid. However, in each round a player may only
buy resources from one of the two markets. Of course, each player may decide for himself which market he will buy from.</p>
<p>In reverse player order, each player chooses one of the two markets from which he will buy resources this round. He must buy all
resources for the round from the market he chooses. If the market chosen has no more of a resource he wants, he will not be able
to buy that resource this round.</p>
<h3>Phase 5: Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>In this phase the players restock the two resource markets according to the resource supply table for Korea. If there are insufficient
resources to restock both markets as shown in the table, restock the north market first and then the south market as much as possible.</p>
<p><b>The Korea resource table is on the last page of these rules.</b></p>
<h1>China</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Chinese economy is structured as a planned economy. In this version of the game, there are no surprises. The power plants on the
power plant market are offered in ascending order during thefirst two steps of the game. Additionally the resource table is designed such
that resources are likely to be in short supply as the game proceeds. Thus, players must plan their resource needs very carefully or find
their grid dark and their incomes reduced.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Auction Power Plants</h3>
<p>In this version, there is no future power plant market. All power plants are always placed and available in the current market.<p>
<p><strong>The first round:</strong> in the first round, place one power plant in the power plant market for each player (with 2 players, use numbers 5 and 6,
with 3 players, use numbers 5, 6, and 7, etc.). The players buy the power plants at auction as normal and each player must buy exactly
one power plant in the first round.</p>
<p class="emp"><strong>Important:</strong> in phase 2, after the purchase of a power plant, no new plant is drawn from the supply! The power plant market is only filled in
phase 5.</p>
<p>During all further rounds of step 1 and step 2: at the beginning of phase 2, there is one fewer power plant in the market than the number
of players.</p>
<p class="emp"><strong>Important:</strong> also, in phase 2 in these rounds, players do not draw a new plant from the supply when one is purchased. Thus, not all players
will be able to buy a power plant each round after the first round. The power plant market is only filled in phase 5.</p>
<p><strong>During step 3:</strong> in step 3, there are always 4 power plants in the market. In the following rounds, as in basic Power Grid, the players draw
a new card from the supply, adding it to the market, whenever a plant is bought.<p>
<p><strong>General rule for all play rounds:</strong> if no player buys a power plant in a round, unlike the basic Power Grid game, no power plant is removed
from the market (however, see phase 5: Bureaucracy).


<h1>France</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Currently France has an emphasis on nuclear power.<p>
<p>This is reflected in the game by a larger supply of uranium and faster access to the first nuclear power plant. The capital city of Paris is
the largest metropolis in the country. Paris is represented as a “triple” city, which makes it an interesting target for power plant owners,
but too much emphasis on Paris may be an incautious player's undoing!<p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>• Paris appears to offer the first building player a great advantage, as he can build the equivalent of 3 cities for no connecting costs.
However, this gives the player no guarantee of a victory. Having 3 cities early in the game can create problems for a player. Also, there
are regions to the north and west of Paris with relatively low connecting costs. If two or more players start in these regions, it will be
expensive for the “Paris” player to build out of Paris. Since in the early rounds, the player will have only a small power plant, but with 3
cities will buy resources last, the player will likely quickly lose whatever advantage he gained with the cheap 3-city build in Paris.</li>
<li>• The price of the first atomic power plant in the market sould not be underestimated. Depending on when the next atomic plant shows up,
a player with the first atomic power plant may benefit from an early monopoly on atomic power.</li>
<li>• We recommend choosing the central France region (containing Paris) as one of regions included in the game. It is too important to
the game to be left out, but if you do, let us know how it works.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Italy</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In Italy, resources are more limited than elsewhere. Both coal and oil can quickly become both scarce and expensive. Combined with
relatively high connecting costs in some parts of the country due to natural geography, players will often find themselves short of cash.</p>

<h1>Central Europe</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Due to the large coal deposits in Poland, the re-supply of coal is larger than in the original game, making coal power plants cheaper to run.
Due to their political stands, neither Poland nor Austria will build nuclear power plants. So, a player may only acquire (or even bid on) a
nuclear plant when he has cities in at least one of the other three countries. The city of Wien has a special status as it gets all its power
from burning garbage - often garbage other countries pay it to take. Thus, a player with Wien in his network will buy garbage at a discount
of 1 Elektro. These changes will offer players new strategies and tactics for this game.</p>
<h2>Playing the game</h2>
<h3>Phase 2: Auction power plants</h3>
<p>A player may only bid on (and buy) a nuclear power plant when his network has at least one city in Hungary, Czech Republic, or Slovakia.
A player whose network includes the cities only in Poland and Austria may not select a nuclear power plant to begin an auction nor bid on
one if a nuclear plant is being auctioned.</p>
<h3>Phase 3: Buying resources</h3>
<p>A player whose network includes the city of Wien buys garbage at a discount of 1 Elektro per piece with the stipulation that his cost per piece
may not be 0. Thus, if he buys from the first space, he pays 1 per piece and does not get the discount for any pieces from space 1.</p>
